This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog on an FPGA platform. FIR filters are widely used in digital signal processing due to their inherent stability and ability to achieve a linear-phase response. The implemented filter is a third-order moving average FIR filter with four taps, utilizing fixed-point arithmetic for efficient hardware realization. Each tap uses a scaled coefficient of 0.25, represented in 6-bit binary to suit FPGA constraints. The design employs D Flip-Flops to store delayed input samples, and the filter output is calculated by summing the products of these delayed inputs with their respective coefficients. Simulation data for the input signal—a sine wave with added noise—was generated using MATLAB and converted into binary format for testing. This project demonstrates how FIR filters can be efficiently realized in hardware using Verilog, offering real-time signal processing capabilities ideal for applications in audio, communication, and embedded systems.
